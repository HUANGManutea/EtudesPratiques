Thank you 
Now we'll talk about Networking.
##In the server

###What is already there:
There is
Unity running on
server
displaying 3D scene
don't code this environment

----------


###The purpose:
effectively
send the model's data
server running Unity

The server catch data
show up the model
3D scene
interact with other objects
not our study


----------


###Plugin:
And in the server
 create a simple plugin 
 only make receive data
 integrated 3Dscene


----------


##In the tablet: 

###External application:
first thought: application
uploading client
use resources
difficult for the user
software pipeline

----------
###Protocol to use:
to convey
Http great download  sort of data (html pages)
Http not made to send this kind of file.

Ftp was too complicated for the user (using a login, a password and an IP adress)

----------

###Unity Assets:

In Unity there  assets like Java Class 
some documentation 
On the internet / books UnityDocumentation
Last but not least:
unity network asset operate great between unity

To simplify, it works like this, like a straightforward road between 2 devices running unity.

we have a unity server
 a huge plus to work on unity
