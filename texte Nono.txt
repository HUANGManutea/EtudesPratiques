Indeed, so we have to design an windows to our application.

diapo 1:
There hese about what we thought. A Frame divide in 3 area and a toolbar.

diapo 2:
On the first zone we got the 2D drawing panel, it's the zone where we will draw our object.
The second it's a vue of the existing 3D models of our project.
And here, the list of these figures and the original frame.


Now, we will see a normal use, our objective it's to draw a red cube. 
And put it on the lft top corner of the grey cube.
Let's started

diapo 3:
To begin we click on the new shape bouton, it allow us to draw on the zone. 
To do that we have access to a drawing menu with some tools.
A 2D cube it's a square so we maked a red square.

Now we want to extrude it.

diapo 4:
When you click on the extrude item, a windows opened and ask you the extruding size.

after that we got the problem to place our cube on the corner. 
for that We choose a reference in our 3D world

diapo 5:
To place an item in a world we have 6 movement possible, 3 translation and 3 rotation. One in each axe.
We wanna to make it simply and easy to use, so we have cut that in 3 part

these parts follow the same way of actions possible.
Firstly we will move the screen to a 2D vue with the point of vue of the arrow

diapo 6:
here we can move the red square with the cursors. 
with this stape we have possibility to move in 2 translation and 1 rotation.

after that the screen will show us a 2D vue of the 2 other direction and allow us the same thing

diapo 7:
with that we have place our object in the 3D environement.
But a last thing can be modify, the size of our item. To that we will put a cursor bar who control that.

So now we have an 3D obect composed by 2 items : a grey and a red cube. 
We want to export it to the server who will put it in the rv room.


diapo 8:
To export just click on the buton export and it's finish.


the last boutons are an edit tool, an delete, an button to switch this two zone and a parameter
a normal user don't have to click on this.







This is our first objective. If we finish that early, we will try to make an tool to make some spheries.
